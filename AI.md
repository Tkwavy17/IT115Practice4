Over the years, the world of information technology has gone through a remarkable evolution, transforming the way we communicate, work, and live in once unimaginable ways. One technology that has recently surfaced within the last few years is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Artificial Intelligence is a technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, problem-solving, comprehension, decision-making, creativity, and autonomy. By utilizing various information collected over time, AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data, automate tasks, and even interact with users conversationally. As time goes on, the capabilities and potential of Artificial Intelligence continue to grow.

Examples of the use of Artificial Intelligence can be found in various forms such as chat-bots, diagnosis tools within healthcare, navigation systems, home appliances, etc. However, despite the many good things that Artificial Intelligence can provide us with, there are many potential harms that something as powerful as AI can cause. Some notable examples of this are the spread of misinformation, algorithmic bias, and the potential for job displacement. Because of these harms, there is a call for a regulated policy to be put in place for the use of AI to ensure that it is used in ways that are fair, transparent, and beneficial to society as a whole.
